# Spaceship Titanic Binary Classification

This project was created as an assignment for my Machine Learning, Artificial Neural Network, and Deep Learning exam. It involves a Binary Classification task within a Kaggle "Getting Started Prediction Competition" using a funny dataset called [Spaceship Titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spaceship-titanic). The primary objective of this project is to predict whether a passenger was transported to an alternate dimension during the Spaceship Titanic's collision with a spacetime anomaly.

## Project Overview

1. **Explanatory Data Analysis (EDA):** I initiated the project with an exploratory data analysis phase. This step helped me gain insights into the dataset's potential features and limitations.

2. **Data Preprocessing:** I applied various data preprocessing techniques to prepare the numerical and categorical data. This involved creating pipelines and column transformers using scikit-learn modules. I also derived new meaningful features to enhance the dataset.

3. **Model Selection:** The prepared data was then used to train multiple machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, and Support Vector Classifier.

4. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** To identify the most suitable model for the task, I performed hyperparameter tuning. This process helped me determine the best parameter settings for each model.

5. **Model Evaluation:** Once the models were trained, I proceeded to evaluate their performance. I utilized standard evaluation measures such as Confusion Matrix, ROC curve, Learning curve, Validation curve, and various performance metrics, with a focus on recall. This emphasis on recall was aimed at minimizing False Negatives, as it was critical for my classification task.

Feel free to explore the code and documentation within this repository to gain a deeper understanding of my approach and findings. If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out.
